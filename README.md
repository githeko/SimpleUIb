Sample GUI code with Lambda Expression

This is a simple Graphic User Interface example showing the use of a lambda expression as an event handler. Beside the lambda expression is an event handler using an abstract class

Labda expression:  btn.setOnAction(event -> handler()); //Lambda expression event handler

public static void main(String[] args)
        {
            Application.launch(args);
        }
